ABOUT
	joj-re8 is a singing speech synthesizer.
	It accepts UST files and UTAU voice libraries.
	It outputs the sound as a wav file.

REQUIREMENTS
	Currently on known to compile on Linux.
	The program itself requires only FFTW3 [www.fftw.org],
	but some of the utilities
	for preparing USTs and voice libraries on Linux have more.
	These utilities are not necessary,
	but you'll have to find another way
	to get the files in the correct format.
	The following are required for all the utilities to function correctly.
		iconv
		dos2unix
		aplay
		ffmpeg
		bsdtar
		convmv

COMPILING
	It uses CMake to bulid.
	-linux:
		$ mkdir -p build
		$ cd build
		$ cmake ..
		$ make

RUNNING
	usage: re8 <ust-filename> <voicelibrary-filename> <output-filename>
	Linux:
		You must have the correct format!
		It is often necessary to convert UST, oto.ini, and prefix.map.
		- To extract an archive (rar/zip/tar), use:

		   $ utils/unzip-jis.sh <filename>

		   The archive will be expanded to <filename>.dir.

		- To convert a file to utf-8 and unix endlines, use:

		   $ utils/format <filename>

		   Make sure to run this on
		   any UST and all the "oto.ini" files and "prefix.map" files inside voice libraries.
		
		Then you should be able to run the re8 command.
