ABOUT
	joj-re8 is a singing speech synthesizer.
	It accepts UST files and UTAU voice libraries.
	It outputs the sound as a wav file.

REQUIREMENTS
	Currently on known to compile on Linux.
	The program itself requires only FFTW3 [www.fftw.org],
	but some of the utilities
	for preparing USTs and voice libraries on Linux have more.
	These utilities are not necessary,
	but you'll have to find another way
	to get the files in the correct format.
	The following are required for all the utilities to function correctly.
		iconv
		dos2unix
		aplay
		ffmpeg
		bsdtar
		convmv

COMPILING
	It uses CMake to bulid.
	-linux:
		$ mkdir -p build
		$ cd build
		$ cmake ..
		$ make

RUNNING
	usage: re8 <ust-filename> <voicelibrary-filename> <output-filename>
		<ust-filename> is the .ust file.
		<voicelibrary-filename> is the name of the directory containing the oto.ini.
		<output-filename> is the wav file to write the audo to.

	utils:
		If you get an archive (rar/zip/tar) from a Windows computer,
		you should probably use utils/unzip-jis.sh to unzip it,
		which will expand the archive to to <filename>.dir.

		If you get an error like "Parsing filters is unsupported.",
		you need to use a different tool to extract,
		and then run utils/format.sh on the extracted directory.

		Then you should be able to run the re8 command on the files inside.


		The reason to do this is because you must have the correct format.
		Most relevant files are made on Windows with a JIS encoding.
		If you have a single file you need converted (oto.ini/ust/prefix.map),
		you can also use utils/format.sh to convert it.

HELP

	problems running the program,
	or suggestions.

LISCENSE
	GPL some version
